            <h3>I love to code</h3>
            <p>I love coding. I think it's obvious. I mostly love to code in Hopscotch, the coding app! I enjoy coding a lot. I know a lot of coding languages, but the main ones are, Python, JavaScript, and Blocks (Hopscotch and Scratch).</p>
          </div>
         <div class="col">
            <h3>I also love to draw</h3>
            <p>The drawing came from making Hopscotch projects because I had to make assets for my games. (It's 1 reason out of so much more why I love Hopscotch) All the images on this website is made by me, by the way! My art really isn't that good but I still get compliments. I know it's confusing. Very.</p>
